### Predicting Stocks with ML

Stockastic is an ML-powered stock price prediction app built with Python and Streamlit. It utilizes machine learning models to forecast stock prices and help investors make data-driven decisions.

## How It's Built

Stockastic is built with these core frameworks and modules:

- Streamlit - To create the web app UI and interactivity 
- YFinance - To fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance API
- StatsModels - To build the ARIMA time series forecasting model
- Plotly - To create interactive financial charts

The app workflow is:

1. User selects a stock ticker
2. Historical data is fetched with YFinance
3. ARIMA model is trained on the data 
4. Model makes multi-day price forecasts
5. Results are plotted with Plotly
